				<p class="d-none d-sm-block">&quot;There are 'go to' people in every trade, but in this certain brand of carpentry and project design there is no one quite like Kris. Forget about his big heartâ€”having fronted endless time and resources in support of the fledgling David Ruggles Center; forget about his uncanny knack for dating the structures he works to restore, born from his sheer native curiosity; Kris figures out the best way to approach the needs of his clients and the building by which they hope to do right.&quot;</p>

Maybe he lives right in here. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted.&quot;</p>
